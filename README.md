# TODO's
* Handle rotation - rotating the device will mess things up.
* iPad - not tested on an iPad, probably needs some tweaking
* Edit - support for editing images in the preview view
* Movies - for now only images are supported. Add support for movies as well
* Performance - probably needs some tweaking to make it fly :)
* Customization - support for customization, sizes, colors, etc
