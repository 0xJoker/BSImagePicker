                                     case BSImageResetCancel:
                                         NSLog(@"Image picker canceled");
                                         break;
                                     case BSImageResetAlbum:
                                         NSLog(@"Image picker changed album");
                                         break;
                                     case BSImageResetDone:
                                         NSLog(@"Image picker done");
                                         break;
                                 }

```
* Toggle get called with a UIImagePickerController compatible dictionary and a BOOL indicating if it was selected or deslected.
* Reset gets called whenever the image selection gets cleared. This happens when user press cancel, done or changes album. It will have an array of dictionaries (if any) and a value indicating which action caused the reset.

Blocks are always called on the main thread.

### Customization
A BSImagePickerController has a few properties you can set:
* You can disable previews by setting previewDisabled to YES.
* Set maximumNumberOfImages to a value to limit selection to a certain number of images.
* Set itemSize to change the size of photos and albums.
* Tint color will change colors on buttons and album and photo checkmark.
# TODO's
* Edit - support for editing images in the preview view
* Movies - for now only images are supported. Add support for movies as well
* Performance - probably needs some tweaking to make it fly :)
