# Use

Present the image picker from a view controller
```objc
[self presentImagePickerController:anImagePicker
                          animated:YES
                        completion:nil
                            toggle:^(ALAsset *asset, BOOL select) {
                                if(select) {
                                    NSLog(@"Image selected");
                                } else {
                                    NSLog(@"Image deselected");
                                }
                            }
                            cancel:^(NSArray *assets) {
                                NSLog(@"User canceled...!");
                            } finish:^(NSArray *assets) {
                                NSLog(@"User finished :)!");
                            }];
```
All blocks are optional and can be nil, so you could for an istance just handle the finish case if you wanted.
* Toggle get called with an ALAsset and a BOOL indicating if it was selected or deselected.
* cancel gets called when the user cancels. It will have an array of ALAssets (if any).
* finish gets called when the user finishes. It will have an array of ALAssets (if any).

Blocks are always called on the main thread.

### Customization (view BSImagePickerController.h to see all properties you can set)
* You can disable previews by setting previewDisabled to YES.
* Setting keepSelection to YES will keep your image selection after dismissing the controller.
* Set maximumNumberOfImages to a value to limit selection to a certain number of images.
* Set itemSize to change the size of photos and albums.
* Tint color will change colors on buttons, album checkmark and photo checkmark.
* Navigation bar tint color will also affect the album view.
* Navigation bar foreground color will also affect text color in album cells.

##### Example
```objc
[anImagePicker.view setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]];
[anImagePicker.navigationBar setBarTintColor:[UIColor blackColor]];
[anImagePicker.view setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blackColor]];
[anImagePicker.navigationBar setTitleTextAttributes:@{NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [UIColor whiteColor]}];
```

# TODO's
